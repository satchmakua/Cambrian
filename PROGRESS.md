# PROGRESS — Cambrian

A build log of what shipped and the notable decisions behind it. **Keep it honest** —
this is the working memory between build sessions. The forward-looking plan and
acceptance tests live in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); this is the backward-looking
"what got done and why" companion.

**Current phase:** Phase 1. M0–M2 built and self-verified (incl. in-browser); awaiting
acceptance test. **M2 makes it a real toy** — pick offspring to steer evolution.

## M2 — Mutate + breeder loop · built 2026-06-27 (awaiting test)

The core toy. Added `src/engine/mutate.ts` — `mutate(parent, streamSeed, n)` deep-clones
the parent (no in-place mutation), derives a reproducible child seed via
`mix32(parent.seed, streamSeed, n)`, and applies the four operator classes from DESIGN
§4.5 with tunable `DEFAULT_RATES` (point 0.30 / structural 0.15 / duplication 0.08 / macro
0.02). Point mutations use a Box-Muller Gaussian (σ = 8% of each gene's range) and clamp to
`GENE_BOUNDS`; structural/duplication ops respect the appendage-count and chain-depth caps —
so every mutant is in-bounds and growable by construction. `src/engine/selection.ts` adds
`breederOffspring`. UI: `OffspringGallery` (3×3) of `OffspringThumb`s (small
`frameloop="demand"` canvases auto-framed by drei `<Bounds>`); the Zustand store now tracks
parent + generation + litter, with `promote` / `reroll` / `newCreature`.

**Verified (2026-06-27):** `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm test` → **22/22 passing** —
including mutation determinism, *parent-not-mutated*, **200 parents × 9 mutants all within
bounds & growable**, litter variety, and a **cumulative-selection** test (greedily picking
"more nodes" across 25 generations reliably grows the creature — steerability, proven
headlessly). `npm run build` → succeeds. **In-browser:** gallery shows 9 live thumbnails
(10 WebGL contexts total, no context-loss warnings); clicking a thumb promotes it — verified
the chain Gen 0→1→2→3 with the parent changing each time (`0xC0FFEE`/24n → `0x29e621cf`/28n
→ `0x29e6…`→ `0x9543…`/23n) and a fresh litter breeding; "new litter" re-breeds without
changing the parent. No console errors.

_Decision:_ each thumbnail is its own small WebGL canvas (10 contexts total). Fine at this
scale and simplest; if a future milestone pushes context count up, switch the gallery to
drei `<View>` (many views, one canvas). Also added `PORT` env support to `vite.config.ts`
so the preview/launch harness's port handoff works cleanly.

## M1 — Random creatures · built 2026-06-27 (awaiting test)

Added `src/engine/random.ts`: a bounds-driven `randomGenome(seed)` that builds *coherent*
critters (a torso with a 1–3 leg-belt, sometimes a dorsal/side fin, a ~60% head segment
with eyes; 70/20/10 bilateral/radial/none symmetry) rather than the maximally-chaotic
genomes the fuzz test throws at `grow`. Every draw flows from the seed, so a seed
reproduces the whole creature. Wired the store's `newCreature()` + the "New random
creature" button to it (replacing M0's jitter-only re-roll).

Refactored the test invariants into `tests/engine/invariants.ts` (shared
`expectValidPhenotype` + new `expectGenomeWithinBounds`) and added
`tests/engine/random.test.ts`. One bug caught by the new bounds test and fixed: eye
`length` drew from `[0.12, 0.28)`, below the `GENE_BOUNDS.appendage.length` floor of `0.2`
— tightened to `[0.2, 0.3)`. (Good sign the bounds guard works.)

**Verified (2026-06-27):** `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm test` → **16/16 passing**
(determinism of `randomGenome`, every gene within `GENE_BOUNDS` across 2000 seeds, valid
phenotype across 2000 seeds, plus the M0 suite); `npm run build` → succeeds. **In-browser**
(via preview + `window.__cambrian`): default creature grew to 24 nodes/23 edges; clicking
"New random creature" produced distinct valid creatures (seeds `0xC0FFEE` → `1607188934`
→ `0x594fde73`, node counts 24→22, each a valid tree) with the HUD seed updating
reactively on a live WebGL canvas — the full button→store→regrow→render pipeline works.

_Tooling note:_ the headless preview can't screenshot the continuously-animating WebGL
canvas (rAF is throttled when the tab isn't foregrounded), and its autoPort handoff to
Vite mismatched (Vite picked its own free port). Verify visuals via `window.__cambrian`
state + `preview_eval`, or just open the dev URL directly.

## M0 — Walking skeleton · built 2026-06-27 (awaiting test)

Scaffolded the project in place from the existing `DESIGN.md`. Stood up the house R3F
stack (React 18.3 · three 0.169 · R3F 8.17 · drei 9.114 · Zustand 5 · Vite 5.4 ·
Vitest 2.1 · TS 5.6) and delivered a thin but real end-to-end slice:
`defaultGenome()` → `grow()` → capsule-union mesh, rendered on a slow turntable under
drei `<Stage>` with an orbit camera and a small HUD (seed, node/edge counts, re-roll).

**Key decisions (see ADR-0002):** the evolution engine is pure and dependency-free —
no three.js/React imports — with inlined vec/quat math, so it's node-testable and can
later evolve headlessly. `Math.random` is banned under `src/engine/` (enforced by a
test); all randomness is the seeded `mulberry32`. Meshing is capsule-union (robust for
any topology) rather than the stretch metaball skin. Dropped the draft's `seedrandom`
dependency in favor of inline mulberry32.

**Verified (2026-06-27):** `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm test` → **11/11 passing**
(grow-twice deep-equal determinism, the §4.4 invariants asserted across a 2000-genome
fuzz run, RNG determinism + order-sensitivity, and the Math.random-ban guard);
`npm run build` → succeeds (≈298 kB gzip, mostly three.js). Dev server boots and serves
Cambrian's own HTML (verified on :5174 — :5173 was held by another project at the time).
Headless handle `window.__cambrian` exposes node/edge/seed for behind-the-animation checks.

_Gotcha for the next session:_ the ban-guard test strips comments before scanning, so
doc comments may mention `Math.random` freely — only real code usage is forbidden.
